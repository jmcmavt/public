# Public Repo

Hi, thanks for stopping by my public repo. 

In here are a collection of code samples, scripts, and other work (in various languages). If you're just stopping by, you are free to take any code from here and modify/use it however you wish, however, know that all code is provided strictly as-is.

For reasons primarily relating to academic integrity, I only make select samples of my work available to the public. If you would like access to additional works or samples of my work, I'm happy to make that available to you.
